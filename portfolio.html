                    <div class="project-info">
                        <p>A dynamic web application was created, employing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP on AWS EC2 to
                            efficiently manage and showcase music subscription services. This included implementing user
                            authentication and registration processes through a DynamoDB-backed login system. </p>
                        <p>Additionally, a robust AWS infrastructure was engineered, incorporating S3 for scalable
                            image storage and DynamoDB for real-time data handling, thereby significantly enhancing the
                            app's performance and scalability. A user-friendly interface was designed and seamlessly
                            integrated, enabling subscribers to access and interact with a diverse library of artist
                            images and music information stored in AWS S3 and DynamoDB.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, efforts were made to optimise web application responsiveness and ensure
                            cross-browser compatibility to deliver
                            a smooth user experience.</p>

                    <div class="project-info">
                        <p>The vacuum cleaner game developed in C++ utilised OOP principles, featuring multiple classes
                            responsible for various functions and facilitating navigation across a 10x10 board. This
                            design allowed for a structured approach to managing game mechanics and interactions.</p>
                        <p>A command-line interface was implemented to enhance game interaction, prioritising
                            straightforward command inputs for seamless operation and navigation. This interface
                            provided players with intuitive controls, ensuring an accessible and user-friendly
                            experience.</p>
                        <p>To further enhance gameplay, an easy-to-use control system was built, enabling players to
                            initiate the game, select their vacuum's starting position, and dictate its direction
                            through simple text-based commands. Rigorous testing and refinement were
                            conducted to guarantee smooth operation and a bug-free experience, ensuring an enjoyable
                            gameplay experience for users interacting with the command line interface.</p>

                    <div class="project-info">
                        <p>Leveraging the MCPI library, a procedural Minecraft village generation system was developed
                            in Python, showcasing adept programming skills. Recursion techniques were employed to
                            dynamically split rooms within village houses, ensuring each possessed unique dimensions,
                            significantly enhancing the variety and realism of the generated village. </p>
                        <p>Through the integration of pathways connecting houses and the generation of trees, creativity
                            and problem-solving were demonstrated, adding to the natural and cohesive appearance of the
                            village. </p>
                        <p>Collaboration played a pivotal role in the project's success, as close coordination with team
                            members facilitated effective task management, idea sharing, and resolution of challenges.
                            Through collaborative efforts, project objectives were met efficiently, resulting in a
                            cohesive and well-executed final product. </p>

                    <div class="project-info">
                        <p>Developed "Closing the Gap," a web application aimed at illuminating and educating on
                            socio-economic disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Australia.
                            The backend was engineered using Java and the Javalin framework, employing JDBC and SQLite
                            for efficient data handling and querying of large datasets. This backend architecture
                            ensured robust server-side logic and effective management of diverse socio-economic data.
                        </p>
                        <p>For the frontend, a user-friendly interface was crafted using HTML and CSS, prioritising
                            responsive design and intuitive navigation. Dynamic data visualisations were integrated to
                            enable users to filter and compare socio-economic factors across categories such as health
                            and education, enhancing user engagement and understanding. </p>
                        <p>Collaborative efforts were key to project success, as close coordination with a project
                            partner involved using version control software like Git and GitHub. This facilitated shared
                            responsibilities for design decisions, code implementation, and debugging, ensuring a
                            cohesive and polished final product.</p>

                    <div class="project-info">
                        <p>A rock-paper-scissors game was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS exclusively,
                            showcasing a blend of frontend technologies to create an interactive gaming experience. In
                            the HTML structure, elements were strategically laid out to facilitate user interaction,
                            including buttons for selecting rock, paper, or scissors, as well as areas for displaying
                            game outcomes and scores.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript served as the backbone of the game, handling the logic behind player selections,
                            computer-generated choices, and determining the winner for each round. Event listeners were
                            employed to detect user clicks on the choice buttons, triggering the corresponding actions
                            within the game's logic. Conditional statements were utilised to compare player and computer
                            choices, with the outcomes dynamically updated in the HTML elements to reflect the results
                            of each round. This implementation resulted in a seamless and engaging rock-paper-scissors
                            game experience, demonstrating the power and versatility of frontend web technologies for
                            developing interactive applications.</p>

                        <p>Analysed a Facebook metrics dataset derived from a publicly accessible source, specifically
                            examining posts from a prominent cosmetics brand's Facebook page in 2014. To ensure the
                            data's quality and appropriateness for analysis, comprehensive data cleaning and
                            preprocessing techniques were applied. This involved addressing missing values and
                            standardising formats to facilitate accurate insights extraction. </p>
                        <p>Exploratory data analysis techniques were then employed to visually depict trends, patterns,
                            and relationships inherent within the dataset. Utilising tools such as Matplotlib, valuable
                            insights into the performance of posts were gleaned, shedding light on crucial aspects of
                            the brand's Facebook presence. </p>
                        <p>Collaboration was central to the project's success, with team
                            members utilising Jupyter Notebook as the primary environment for data analysis, code
                            execution, and project documentation. This collaborative approach fostered efficient sharing
                            of findings and methodologies, contributing to a thorough and insightful analysis of the
                            Facebook metrics dataset.</p>
